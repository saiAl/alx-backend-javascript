ES6 is a major revision of JavaScript that introduced several new features and improvements.

 It aims to make JavaScript code more concise, readable, and maintainable.

New Features in ES6

    Modules: A new way to organize code into reusable modules.
    Classes: Syntactic sugar for creating object-oriented code.
    Arrow Functions: Concise way to define functions.
    Template Literals: Embed expressions within strings for easier formatting.
    Destructuring: Extract data from arrays and objects in a cleaner way.
    Let and Const: Block-scoped variables for better code organization.
    Rest and Spread Operators: Handle variable arguments and object properties more efficiently.
    Promises: Improved asynchronous programming.
    Iterators and for-of loops: Iterate over data structures more easily.

Constants vs. Variables

    Const: Declares a block-scoped variable whose value cannot be changed after assignment.
    Let: Declares a block-scoped variable whose value can be changed.

Block-Scoped Variables

let and const create variables that are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g., if statement, for loop). This helps prevent accidental variable reassignment and improves code clarity.

Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for defining functions. They automatically bind the this keyword to the surrounding context and can optionally omit the return keyword for single-line expressions.

Rest and Spread Parameters

    Rest Parameters: Collect an indefinite number of arguments into an array.
    Spread Operator: Expands iterable objects (like arrays) into individual elements.

String Templating

Template literals (backticks) allow embedding expressions within strings for easy string formatting and concatenation.

Object Creation and Properties

    Object Destructuring: Extract properties from objects into individual variables.
    Shorthand Properties: Define object properties with the same name as their assigned value.
    Computed Property Names: Use expressions to dynamically define object property names.

Iterators and for-of Loops

Iterators provide a way to access elements of a data structure one at a time. The for-of loop iterates over iterators, making it easier to loop through arrays, strings, and other iterable objects.
