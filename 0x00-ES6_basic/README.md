1. Variable Declarations: Taking Control

    const: Declare constants that remain fixed throughout your program.
    let: Create block-scoped variables for localized control.
    var: The traditional declaration, but use cautiously due to potential hoisting issues.

2. Arrow Functions: Writing Concisely

    Write shorter, cleaner functions with arrow syntax, often simplifying single-expression scenarios.

3. Default Parameters: Providing Backups

    Set default values for function arguments, ensuring predictable behavior even with missing arguments.

4. Rest Parameters: Capturing the Unknown

    Collect remaining function arguments into an array, handling situations with an unknown number of arguments.

5. Spread Syntax: Expanding Iterables

    Unpack arrays, strings, or objects within expressions, allowing flexible manipulation of data structures.

6. Template Literals: Crafting Strings with Flair

    Create more readable strings, embedding expressions and enabling multi-line strings.

7. Object Key Names: Dynamic Properties

    Define object property names dynamically using expressions within square brackets, enhancing flexibility.

8. ES6 Computed Property Names:

    Similar to dynamic key names, computed property names allow you to use expressions to define property keys at runtime.

9. ES6 Method Properties:

    Define methods directly within object literals using a concise syntax, improving code organization.

10. ES6's for...of:

    Iterate over iterable objects (like arrays) in a more straightforward way, extracting values directly.

11. ES6 Objects:

    ES6 introduces several enhancements to objects, including property shorthand, destructuring, and more.
